# 📝 Ideation

We came up with this idea after seeing what happened during the our Covid-19 vaccination drive. People had to wait in long queues for their turn of vaccination but it was very risky for everyone. So, we thought to help them using some technology. 

So, that's our idea we would allow the person providing any service to generate a QR-code, which when scanned by users while allot them a queue number. This simple sounding project is very efficient and also can be used in **every sector.**
